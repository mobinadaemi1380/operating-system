REFEREE
prevent user from accessing others files without permission
Even after a files is deleting and its space re_used 
Illusionist 
Files cab grow arbitrarily large
Files persist even when the machine crashes in the middle of a save 
Glue 
Named directories ,printf

Reliability
Does the system do what it was designed to do?

Availability
What portion of the time is the system working?

Security

Mean time to Failure MTTF . Mean time to Repair
Can the system be compromised by an attacker?

Privacy
Data is acceptable only to authorized users

Direct memory access(DMA)is the process of transferring data without the involvement of the processor itself.
It is often used for transferring data to /from input/output devices.
A separate DMA controller is required to Handel the transfer .
The controller notifies the DSP processor that it is ready for a transfer.

Governments use permits to allocate some resources like petroleum, natural gas, etc. A company that wants to drill or mine for example must first get a permit to do so. To isolate misuse government pass legislation that define what misuse is what what the consequence for misuse is. Typically theyâ€™ll impose 
fines or even incarcerate individuals that misuse resources.

So you can take me as  an example as a computer engineering student I would prioritize reliability, security, and performance first then adoption and at last portability
So I believe that prioritizing between these options is a matter of user's preference
